Special authorisation to use Octocat in Neverball was requested in November 2013 and given by GitHub according to the following dialogue.


Request made by Josh "Cheeseness" Bush on behalf of the Neverball community:
> Hi there! We've just moved our F/OSS project [Neverball](https://github.com/Neverball/neverball) to GitHub and would  like to add an Octocat themed bonus ball in the game to celebrate.

> I have made a work-in-progress ball, but would like to seek permission before including it in the game, as it seems to be outside the preferred usage.

> Many thanks <3

> Cheese


Response from Haleigh on behalf of GitHub Staff:
> Hi Cheese,

> I bring you rad tidings from the Octocat-tamers! It's totally cool for you to include the Octocat bonus ball in the way you've outlined.

> Thanks so much for checking in with us first, and happy new-GitHub-home to Neverball!

> Cheers,

> Haleigh
