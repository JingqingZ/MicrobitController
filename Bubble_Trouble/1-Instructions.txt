Environment:
	- Microsoft Windows 10
	- Python version 3.5.2
	- Required Packages:
		1- serial   ( Serial input through COM PORT)
		2- pyatogui (Generates Keyboard Commands in Windows)

	
Set-up:
	A- Download Controller_Microbit(s).py onto the micro:bit(s) to be used as game controllers after making sure
that a distinct player id is assigned to each player.

	B- Download Server_Microbit.py onto a micro:bit to be used as the game server attached to the PC after specifying
the correct COM Port number. To verify the designated COM Port:
		1- Connect the micro:bit to your PC using the micro USB cable.
		2- Go to device manager and expand ports
		3- Determine the COM Port number assigned to mbed Serial Port.

	C- Run the python script Game_Control_Parser.py in a terminal.
		python Game_Control_Parser.py

	D- Open the online game: https://www.miniclip.com/games/bubble-trouble/en/#t-ss-S


Playing the game:

	A- The server microbit first asks whether the game option to be chosen is 1 or 2 players.
	   Selecting the pushbutton A indicates one player, whereas pushbutton B indicates two players
	   Once you are happy with your choice, press the two pushbuttons simultaneously for selection.
	   The word GO! flashes on the screen indicating the server is ready.

	B- Since two control modes are implemented on the game controller micro:bit(s), a player is asked whether
           he/she wishes to use control mode 1 or 2.

	   Control Mode 1 (Purely dependent on Accelerometer):
		Titlting the micro:bit to the right --> go right
		Tilting the micro:bit to the left --> go left	
		Tilting the micro:bit upwards --> fire rope

	   Control Mode 2 (Push Buttons and Accelerometer):
		Pressing PushButton B --> go right
		Pressing PushButton A --> go left	
		Tilting the micro:bit upwards --> fire rope

           Similar to choosing the number of players, pushbutton A indicates mode 1, whereas pushbutton B indicates mode 2.
	   Hold both buttons simultaneously upon selection to start playing.
	   Your Micro:bit player id should appear on the screen indicating that your controller is ready for use.

	C- Select 1/2 players similarly on the PC screen and start playing !
